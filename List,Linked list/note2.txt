Type of Linked List
    - Single linked List
    - Double linked List
    - Circular linked List
    - Circular doubly linked List


    Structure of node of singly linked List
        We can define a node as follows
        struct Node
            {
                int info;
                struct Node *next;
            };
    typedef struct Node NodeType;
        NodeType *first;// first is a pointer type structure variable that points to first node.
        NodeType *last ; // last is a pointer structure variable that points to last node.

        An algorithm to insert a node at the begining of the singly linked List
        let 'first' and 'last' are the pointer to first node and last node in the current list respectively.

        - start
        - Create a new node using malloc function as,
            Newnode = (NodeType*)malloc(sizeof(NodeType));
        - Read data item to be inserted say 'el'
        -Assign data to the info field of new node
            Newnode.info =el;
        -set next of new node to first
            Newnode.next = first;
        -set the fist pointer to the new node
            first = Newnode;
        -End
